# Dolly3

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/dolly3`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dolly'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dolly

This gem is expecting a couchdb.yml file in a config folder, this folder must be in your root directory; follow this link to get the template:
https://github.com/amco/dolly/blob/3.1/config/couchdb.yml

## Usage

On non rails enviroment add the following gems

```ruby
require 'set'
require 'yaml'
require 'json'
```

To use it declare a class and inherit from Dolly::Document

```ruby
class Teacher < Dolly::Document
    property :name #this property will be saved on DB

end
```

Now you have access to Instance methods, you can get a glimpse of them on the following link:
https://github.com/enrand22/dolly/blob/3.1/lib/dolly/query.rb

And to class methods:
https://github.com/amco/dolly/blob/3.1/lib/dolly/document_state.rb

You can use the class like this:

```ruby
teacher = Teacher.new({:name => "enrique"})
teacher.save!
puts teacher.id #id is stored after the save! 
```

Also, it's possible to create using an instance method:

```ruby
teacher2 = Teacher.find teacher.id
puts teacher2.name
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

```
$ ./couchup list           # Shows your unmigrated 1.x databases
$ ./couchup replicate -a   # Replicates your 1.x DBs to 2.x
$ ./couchup rebuild -a     # Optional; starts rebuilding your views
$ ./couchup delete -a      # Deletes your 1.x DBs (careful!)
